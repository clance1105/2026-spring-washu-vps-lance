        This piece really clicked for me because it puts words to a feeling I’ve had but couldn’t quite explain. I’m constantly seeing things online that look impressive or polished, but feel weirdly empty once you actually stop and look. The idea that AI isn’t just “tricking” us, but flattening expression into something generic, feels very true especially in creative and academic spaces. What stood out most was the shift from asking “Was this made by AI?” to “How much humanity is in this?” That feels like a much more useful and generous question. It reframes creativity as relational instead of technical. It’s not about perfection or polish, but about intention, specificity, and presence. I also liked how this avoids the pointless gotcha of accusing people of using AI. Instead, it raises the bar in a way that actually helps people make better work.
