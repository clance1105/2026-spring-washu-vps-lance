        What’s interesting about this article is how these old restaurant websites feel way more honest and human than most polished sites now. They’re messy, text-heavy, sometimes ugly, but they actually tell you what the place feels like before you go. It’s kind of wild that you don’t even need photos when the fonts, colors, and weird layout already do the job. The idea that these sites are disappearing because everything’s getting shoved into Google, Yelp, or templates is lowkey sad. It makes you realize how rare it’s becoming to see a business just exist online without trying to optimize or sell something.
